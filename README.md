# WhatsApp-Chat-Analysis
Developed a Python tool for WhatsApp chat analysis, extracting message statistics, author identification, and date-based analysis. Features include visualizations like word clouds and message length analysis, providing insights into chat patterns. Designed for efficient handling of large chat files, the tool ensures accurate data parsing.

Note: For the analysis, we used our own WhatsApp group chat data. However, you are welcome to use your own chat data; simply export the group chat data from WhatsApp.
